/*
3.	Floating Equality
Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers (double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note that we cannot directly compare two floating-point numbers a and b by a==b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic.
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more close to each other than some fixed constant eps.
You will receive two lines, each containing a floating-point number. Your task is to compare the values of the two numbers.
