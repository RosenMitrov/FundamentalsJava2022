/*
6.	Balanced Brackets
You will receive n lines. On those lines, you will receive one of the following:
•	Opening bracket – "(",
•	Closing bracket – ")" or
•	Random string
Your task is to find out if the brackets are balanced.
That means after every opening bracket should follow a closing one.
Nested parentheses are not valid, and if two consecutive opening brackets exist,
the expression should be marked as unbalanced.
Input
•	On the first line, you will receive n – the number of lines, which will follow.
•	On the next n lines, you will receive "(", ")" or another string.
Output
You have to print "BALANCED" if the parentheses are balanced and "UNBALANCED" otherwise.
